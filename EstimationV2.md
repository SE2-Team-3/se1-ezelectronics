# Estimation approach
Consider the EZElectronics  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by your team in requirements V2), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch (not from V1)
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |                   28          |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                   55         | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1,540|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |       154                               |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 4,620| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    7.7                |

# Summary
Since the "estimate by size" is not accurate due to not taking into account the productivity of group members, the difference between estimates is observed.

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |154| 7.7
| estimate by product decomposition |124| 6.2
| estimate by activity decomposition |126| 6.3
